# Bike-share Analysis Case Study
The purpose of this case study is to analyze the data of a fictional company and create a recommended solution for their business needs in order to showcase my data analysis skills.

A bike-share company in Chicago named Cyclistic wants to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

**Python and Jupyter Notebook was used for the data analysis process**

## 1. Defining the business task
  * The aim of this project is to recommend at most 3 strategies that will help convert causal riders to annual members of Cyclistic. In order to conduct the analysis, bike-share data from the past 12 months needs to be utilized for the analysis. Python will be utilized for the manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of the provided data.

## 2. Description of data sources used
  * The dataset has been made available by
  **Motivate International Inc.** under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
